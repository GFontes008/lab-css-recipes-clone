      <h3>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar, and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
      <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes until apples are soft.</li>
